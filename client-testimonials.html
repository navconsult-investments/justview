                          As a Fund-of-Funds manager, we frequently get tax
                          questions from our investors. CIN stays abreast of
                          changes in the tax laws, and makes themselves
                          available to us to offer timely, accurate responses.
                          This allows us to be extremely responsive. We value
                          them as a business partner, and I highly recommend
                          their services. As COO, I have confidence in the work
                          they do, and the turnaround time for our completed tax
                          forms is reasonable. We have no regrets about

                          CIN. That shouldn’t be remarkable, but in our past
                          experience it has been a challenge, and that reliable
